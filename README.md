- I'm ErrorCorrupt, but please call me Error.
- I suck at code, but I do want to participate in the GitHub Community.
- I like technologies like Rust, Python, Ruby, C++, and TypeScript (TS).
- I like to develop very basic websites and applications.
- If you ever see good code here, I'll be dead, have copied it from StackOverflow, or have it be generated by ChatGPT or any other AI.
